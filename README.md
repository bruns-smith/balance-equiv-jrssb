# Replication materials for "Augmented balancing weights as linear regression".

The code for producing figures and tables are available in Jupyter notebooks. Some supporting code is separated into .py files and imported where appropriate. Email bruns-smith (at) berkeley (dot) edu with any questions.

## Main Text:

 - "Figures_1_and_2.ipynb" contains the code for replicating Figures 1 and 2 in the main text. This notebook is standalone.
 - "Lalonde_Long_Figure_3.ipynb" contains the code replicating Figure 3 in the main text. It uses some code from "hyperparam.py".
 - "Lalonde_Short_Figure_4.ipynb" contains the code replicating Figure 4 in the main text. It uses some code from "hyperparam.py".
 - "Simulation_Study.ipynb" contains the code for replicating Table 1 in the main text. It uses functions imported from "hyperparam.py", "ridge_dgps.py", and "ridge_theory.py".

## Appendix:

- "Ridge_Rotation_Appendix.ipynb" contains code for reproducing the numerical counterexamples from Appendix C.
- "Lalonde_Entropy_Appendix.ipynb" contains code for replicating Figure D.1.
- "IHDP_Long_Appendix.ipynb" and "IHDP_Short_Appendix.ipynb" contain code for reproducing the figures in Appendix I.
